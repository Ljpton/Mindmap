I would take the programming and game design part while [[link:https://junior17.itch.io/|Jannick Jade Elfers]] would create all the graphics and characteres for the game. We were given a lot of freedom in the conception of the game, but it should have a serious game aspect where students could learn about how democracy works and what's important for it. [[img:img/diktatoren_01.jpg]] So we decided to create a small experience where players would take the role of a dictator who has to make decisions that would either lead to a dictatorship or a democracy. Each decision has consequences for different parameters like economy, military but also human rights and freedom of speech. We tried to balance the decisions in a way that would naturally lead players to democratic decisions because autocratic decisions would gain only short-term benefits but would lead to long-term disadvantages and eventually to a revolution. [[img:img/diktatoren_02.jpg]] [[img:img/diktatoren_03.jpg]] In the same way, we wanted to showcase how difficult it is to maintain a democracy. The closer players got to a democracy and thus the good ending of the game, the harder they were punished for breaking the rules of democracy, even if it gained them a lot of highly needed benefits in other areas. Fittingly we called the game [[link:https://fernofai.itch.io/schule-der-demokraten|Schule der Demokraten]] (School of Democrats) as opposed to the original title of the play.",

[[img:img/unisurvive_02.jpg]] The game is played cooperatively by 2-4 players and communication and teamwork is greatly rewarded - or let's say: playing only for yourself is heavily punished. Only when all of you survive one semestre, you win the game and are judged by your final grades. [[img:img/unisurvive_03.jpg]] We were really fast with prototyping a first version of the game and thus were able to iterate a lot on the different mechanics and details. [[img:img/unisurvive_01.jpg]] As an extra challenge we were also given the limitation to fit the whole game into a predefined box size, which was quite a struggle.

I initially wanted to make a narrative-driven game with a dark atmosphere, which was quite a struggle given the theme 'Bubbles'. But I am very happy with the twisted obsession I made up of a person who has the urge to pierce or pop everything they can. Through harmless things like the mandatory soap bubbles and balloons I told the story through the eyes of the hermit, turning darker and darker when they can't stop punching holes in a letter from a friend and eventually locking up named friend by barricading the door. [[img:img/bats_02.jpg]] I only wanted to let the players see the (quite foreseeable) ending when they found every other piece of the story first, so they could figure it out for themselves first. Accidentally by this I created something very similar to what I was currently researching in my master thesis: games where you can only progress by understanding the story. With more time I would have implemented a mechanic that would require the players not only to find all clues but also put them in the correct chronological order - which would prove a much more comprehensive understanding of the story - before allowing them to see what the hermit has hidden under the trapdoor right in the middle of his hut.",

The sensation of hearing and feeling where the marble might be rolling was so fascinating to me that I wanted to recreate it as a digital game. [[img:img/blackbox_01.png]] So I developed Black Box as a mobile game for Android where you can tilt your phone just like the matchbox to roll a marble through a labyrinth. You can play the game without looking at the screen and even without sound, just by feeling the vibrations of the phone. But you can also turn on an easy mode, where you see the whole labyrinth when your marble got lost. I also went through the whole process of testing and publishing the game on the Google Play Store, where you can [[link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Fernofai.BlackBox|download and play]] it for free.",

For this purpose Ariadne is waiting at the entrance of the maze and is holding a long thread.

[[img:img/ariadne_01.jpg]] Both Ariadne and Theseus get trapped in the labyrinth and have to call for each other repeatedly to find out in which direction they have to walk. I also implemented a puzzley-mechanic were both characters would be controlled the same, so one could only approach the other when they were blocked by some obstacle. The theme for the jam was 'Two' by the way.

It was a classic mobile endless runner game where the player had to run away from a tsunami wave through different biomes.

For the different tracks I made sure they are in the same key and tempo, so they could be blended over each other seamlessly when the player reached a new biome. This first track is the main menu theme of the game, when the character is laying on the beach without a clue what is about to happen: [[audio:audio/tsunamirun_menu.mp3]] The second track is for the first beach biome, having a similar style like the menu theme, but with a more upbeat and adventurous feel: [[audio:audio/tsunamirun_beach.mp3]] The third track is for the second biome, which is a jungle. It has a more mysterious and dark atmosphere, which always reminds me of the volcano world in a Garfield Jump'n'Run I played on the Nintendo DS when I was younger: [[audio:audio/tsunamirun_jungle.mp3]] The fourth track takes the player to the planet Mars. The character hoped to be able to escape the tsunami by escaping Earth, but unfortunately the tsunami grew to an interplanetary size to follow the player to Mars - whoops!

Since I was into Chess that time I took the opportunity to model a set of Chess pieces, a Chess clock and set up this room where two people played a game of Chess. One player got angry, hit the table and knocked over the chair as he stood up and left the room. [[img:img/chess_01.jpg]] Experienced players could also recognize the 'Immortal Game' of 1851 which I set up on the board to give the scene even more depth. [[img:img/chess_02.jpg]]",

For that I not only reimagined them as antropomorph figures, thinking of Sherlock as the loner cat being smart, sometimes grumpy or even malicious and only interested in the mystery itself, while John had to be a caring and empathetic dog. [[gif:img/sherlock.gif]] I also put them in a small comic story for which I blocked out Sherlocks office and drew over the characters for a short scene that should give a good impression of the characters and their behaviors. Unfortunately the comic is in german, but I tried to work out the expressions and personalities of the characters as visual as possible.",
